# Tonsillectomy - Patient Information

## What is a Tonsillectomy?

A tonsillectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the palatine tonsils, which are two oval-shaped tissue masses located at the back of the throat. This is one of the most common surgical procedures performed in otolaryngology.

## Indications

A tonsillectomy may be recommended for:

- **Recurrent Tonsillitis**: 7+ episodes in one year, 5+ per year for two years, or 3+ per year for three years
- **Chronic Tonsillitis**: Persistent infection despite antibiotic treatment
- **Obstructive Sleep Apnea**: Enlarged tonsils causing breathing difficulties during sleep
- **Peritonsillar Abscess**: Recurrent or complicated abscess formation
- **Tonsillar Hypertrophy**: Enlarged tonsils causing difficulty swallowing or breathing
- **Suspected Malignancy**: Asymmetric tonsil enlargement requiring tissue diagnosis

## Pre-Operative Preparation

- **Medical History Review**: Inform your surgeon of all medications, allergies, and medical conditions
- **Blood Tests**: May be required to check clotting function
- **Fasting**: No food or drink for at least 6-8 hours before surgery
- **Medications**: Stop aspirin, ibuprofen, and blood thinners as directed by your surgeon
- **Arrangements**: Plan for someone to drive you home and stay with you for 24-48 hours

## The Procedure

- **Anesthesia**: General anesthesia (you will be asleep)
- **Duration**: Typically 30-45 minutes
- **Technique**: Several methods may be used including:
  - Cold steel dissection
  - Electrocautery
  - Coblation (radiofrequency energy)
  - Harmonic scalpel
- **Hospital Stay**: Usually outpatient (same day discharge) or overnight observation

## Post-Operative Care

### Pain Management
- **Pain Levels**: Expect significant throat pain, especially days 5-10
- **Medications**: Take prescribed pain medication as directed
- **Ice Packs**: Apply to neck for comfort
- **Positioning**: Keep head elevated when sleeping

### Diet
- **First 24 Hours**: Cold liquids (water, juice, popsicles)
- **Days 2-7**: Soft, cool foods (yogurt, pudding, mashed potatoes, ice cream)
- **Days 8-14**: Gradually return to normal diet
- **Avoid**: Hot, spicy, acidic, crunchy, or sharp foods for 2 weeks

### Activity
- **Rest**: Plan for 7-10 days off work/school
- **No Strenuous Activity**: Avoid for 2 weeks
- **No Flying**: Wait at least 7-10 days
- **Return to Normal**: Typically after 2 weeks

### Hydration
- **Critical**: Drink plenty of fluids (8-10 glasses per day)
- **Purpose**: Prevents dehydration and keeps throat moist
- **Signs of Dehydration**: Dark urine, dizziness, decreased urination

## Potential Risks and Complications

### Common (Occur in >1% of patients)

1. **Pain and Discomfort**
   - Severe throat pain lasting 7-14 days
   - Ear pain (referred pain from throat)
   - Jaw stiffness and muscle soreness
   - Bad breath (halitosis) during healing

2. **Bleeding**
   - **Minor**: Small streaks of blood in saliva (normal in first 24 hours)
   - **Primary Hemorrhage**: Within 24 hours of surgery (1-2% risk)
   - **Secondary Hemorrhage**: Days 5-10 post-op as scabs fall off (3-5% risk)
   - **Action**: Contact surgeon immediately if bleeding is persistent or heavy

3. **Nausea and Vomiting**
   - Common in first 24-48 hours
   - May see old blood from surgery
   - Anti-nausea medication available

4. **Fever**
   - Low-grade fever (<101°F) is common for first few days
   - Higher fever may indicate infection

5. **Dehydration**
   - Due to pain with swallowing
   - May require IV fluids if severe

### Uncommon (Occur in <1% of patients)

1. **Significant Bleeding**
   - May require return to operating room (1-3%)
   - Can be life-threatening if severe
   - Blood transfusion rarely needed

2. **Infection**
   - Wound infection requiring antibiotics
   - Deep neck infection (rare)

3. **Anesthetic Complications**
   - Allergic reactions
   - Breathing difficulties
   - Cardiovascular events (very rare)

4. **Dental Injury**
   - Chipped or loosened teeth
   - Lip or tongue injury

### Rare (Occur in <0.1% of patients)

1. **Voice Changes**
   - Temporary or permanent changes to voice quality
   - Velopharyngeal insufficiency (nasal-sounding speech)

2. **Taste Changes**
   - Temporary or permanent alteration in taste
   - Usually resolves within weeks to months

3. **Aspiration**
   - Food or liquid entering airway
   - Pneumonia risk

4. **Severe Complications**
   - Airway swelling requiring intubation
   - Carotid artery injury (extremely rare)
   - Death (estimated 1 in 35,000)

## Warning Signs - Seek Immediate Medical Attention

Contact your surgeon or go to the emergency room if you experience:

- **Heavy Bleeding**: Bright red blood, continuous bleeding, or spitting/vomiting blood
- **Difficulty Breathing**: Severe swelling, wheezing, or shortness of breath
- **High Fever**: Temperature >102°F (38.9°C)
- **Severe Dehydration**: Unable to drink fluids, dark urine, dizziness
- **Severe Pain**: Uncontrolled by prescribed medication
- **Stiff Neck**: With fever (possible meningitis)

## Expected Healing Timeline

- **Days 1-3**: Most painful period, white/gray coating forms (normal healing)
- **Days 4-7**: Pain continues, scabs begin forming
- **Days 8-10**: Scabs begin falling off (peak bleeding risk)
- **Days 11-14**: Gradual improvement in pain
- **Weeks 3-4**: Most healing complete, pink tissue visible
- **Full Recovery**: 4-6 weeks for complete healing

## Follow-Up Care

- **Post-Op Visit**: Typically scheduled 2-3 weeks after surgery
- **Purpose**: Ensure proper healing, address any concerns
- **Bring**: List of questions or concerns

## Special Considerations

### Children
- Generally recover faster than adults
- May have behavioral changes temporarily
- Need close supervision for 24-48 hours

### Adults
- More painful recovery than children
- Higher bleeding risk
- Longer recovery period (10-14 days typical)

### Smokers
- **Must Stop**: At least 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after surgery
- **Higher Risk**: Bleeding, delayed healing, infection

## Questions to Ask Your Surgeon

1. What technique will you use for my tonsillectomy?
2. Will I need to stay overnight in the hospital?
3. What pain medication will be prescribed?
4. When can I return to work/school?
5. When can I resume exercise?
6. What should I do if I experience bleeding?
7. Are there any specific restrictions based on my medical history?

## Success Rate and Outcomes

- **Symptom Resolution**: >90% for chronic tonsillitis
- **Quality of Life**: Significant improvement in most patients
- **Recurrence**: Tonsils do not grow back
- **Sleep Apnea**: 70-80% improvement when due to tonsillar hypertrophy

## Long-Term Considerations

- **Immune Function**: Tonsils are part of immune system but their removal does not significantly impact overall immunity
- **Throat Health**: Some patients report fewer sore throats, others report no change
- **Regular Follow-Up**: Important for monitoring healing and addressing any late complications
