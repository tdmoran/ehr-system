# Thyroidectomy - Patient Information

## What is a Thyroidectomy?

A thyroidectomy is surgical removal of all or part of the thyroid gland, a butterfly-shaped endocrine gland located in the front of the neck that produces hormones regulating metabolism, heart rate, and body temperature.

## Types of Thyroidectomy

- **Total Thyroidectomy**: Complete removal of both lobes
- **Hemithyroidectomy (Lobectomy)**: Removal of one lobe
- **Subtotal Thyroidectomy**: Removal of most of gland, leaving small remnant
- **Isthmusectomy**: Removal of central portion connecting lobes
- **Completion Thyroidectomy**: Removal of remaining tissue after previous partial thyroidectomy

## Indications

A thyroidectomy may be recommended for:

### Malignancy
- **Papillary Thyroid Cancer**: Most common (70-80%)
- **Follicular Thyroid Cancer**: 10-15% of cases
- **Medullary Thyroid Cancer**: 5-10% of cases
- **Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer**: Rare, aggressive
- **Thyroid Lymphoma**: Rare
- **Metastatic Cancer**: To thyroid from other sites

### Benign Conditions
- **Multinodular Goiter**: Enlarged thyroid with multiple nodules causing:
  - Compression symptoms (dysphagia, dyspnea)
  - Cosmetic concerns
  - Substernal extension
- **Toxic Multinodular Goiter**: Causing hyperthyroidism
- **Graves' Disease**: Autoimmune hyperthyroidism not controlled with medication
- **Solitary Thyroid Nodule**: Indeterminate or suspicious on biopsy
- **Thyroid Cyst**: Large or symptomatic
- **Thyroiditis**: Rare, if causing severe symptoms

## Pre-Operative Evaluation

### Imaging Studies
- **Ultrasound**: Evaluates thyroid size, nodules, lymph nodes
- **CT/MRI**: For large goiters or substernal extension
- **Radioiodine Scan**: For hyperthyroidism assessment

### Laboratory Tests
- **TSH, T3, T4**: Thyroid function tests
- **Thyroglobulin**: Tumor marker for some cancers
- **Calcitonin**: For medullary thyroid cancer
- **Calcium and PTH**: Baseline parathyroid function
- **Complete Blood Count**: Anemia assessment
- **Vocal Cord Examination**: Laryngoscopy to check vocal cord function before surgery

### Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA)
- Biopsy of suspicious nodules
- Bethesda classification system (I-VI)
- Molecular testing if indeterminate

## Pre-Operative Preparation

### Medical Optimization
- **Hyperthyroid Patients**: Must achieve euthyroid state before surgery
  - Antithyroid medications (methimazole, propylthiouracil)
  - Beta-blockers for symptom control
  - Iodine drops (Lugol's solution) before surgery
- **Cardiac Clearance**: If high-risk patient
- **Medications to Stop**:
  - Aspirin: 1-2 weeks
  - NSAIDs: 1 week

- **Medications**: Take only those approved by surgeon
- **Shower**: Antimicrobial soap if provided
- **Arrangements**: Someone to drive home and stay overnight
- **Duration**: Plan for 3-6 hour hospital stay (including recovery)

## The Procedure

- **Anesthesia**: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation
- **Duration**: 1-3 hours depending on extent
- **Incision**: Low collar incision in natural skin crease (3-6 cm)
- **Technique**:
  1. Skin flaps raised to expose thyroid
  2. Recurrent laryngeal nerves identified and preserved
  3. Parathyroid glands identified and preserved
  4. Superior thyroid vessels ligated
  5. Thyroid gland mobilized and removed
  6. Hemostasis achieved
  7. Drain may be placed
  8. Incision closed in layers
- **Nerve Monitoring**: Intraoperative nerve monitoring often used
- **Frozen Section**: Pathology during surgery if needed
- **Hospital Stay**: Outpatient to 1 night (23-hour observation common)

## Minimally Invasive Options

### Endoscopic/Robotic Thyroidectomy
- Smaller or remote incisions
- Longer operative time
- Not suitable for large goiters or cancer
- Cosmetic benefit

### Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA)

## Special Considerations

### Pregnancy
- **Timing**: Avoid during first trimester if possible
- **Second Trimester**: Safest time if surgery urgent
- **Post-Partum**: Can wait if cancer low-risk
- **Thyroid Hormone**: Needs increase during pregnancy

### Graves' Disease
- **Pre-Op Preparation**: Must be euthyroid before surgery
- **Eye Disease**: May worsen after RAI, less so after surgery
- **Definitive Treatment**: Surgery or RAI

### Large Goiters
- **Tracheomalacia Risk**: Assess pre-operatively
- **Substernal Extension**: May require sternotomy (rare)
- **Longer Hospital Stay**: May need observation

### Previous Neck Surgery/Radiation
- **Scar Tissue**: Makes surgery more challenging
- **Nerve Identification**: More difficult
- **Higher Complication Risk**: Especially nerve injury

## Thyroid Cancer-Specific Considerations

### Risk Stratification
- **Low Risk**: Small tumor, no spread, favorable histology
- **Intermediate Risk**: Larger tumor or minor spread
- **High Risk**: Extensive local invasion or distant metastases

### Additional Treatments
- **Radioactive Iodine (RAI)**:
  - Ablates remaining thyroid tissue and treats microscopic disease
  - Requires low-iodine diet preparation
  - Thyroid hormone withdrawal or Thyrogen injections
  - Temporary isolation after treatment

### Long-Term Surveillance
- **Thyroglobulin**: Tumor marker checked regularly
- **Ultrasound**: Neck ultrasound annually or as needed
- **Whole Body Scan**: If RAI given
- **Lifelong Follow-Up**: With endocrinologist

## Questions to Ask Your Surgeon

1. Will I need a total or partial thyroidectomy?
2. What are my chances of needing thyroid hormone replacement?
3. What are my specific risks for voice injury and low calcium?
4. Will you use nerve monitoring?
5. Will I need a drain?
6. When will I get my pathology results?
7. If cancer, what additional treatment will I need?
