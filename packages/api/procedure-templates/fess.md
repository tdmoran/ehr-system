# Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS) - Patient Information

## What is FESS?

Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS) is a minimally invasive surgical procedure using a small camera (endoscope) to open and improve drainage of the paranasal sinuses. The goal is to restore normal sinus ventilation and function while preserving healthy tissue.

## Sinus Anatomy

The paranasal sinuses include:
- **Maxillary Sinuses**: Cheek area (most commonly affected)
- **Ethmoid Sinuses**: Between the eyes
- **Frontal Sinuses**: Forehead area
- **Sphenoid Sinuses**: Behind the nose, deep in the skull

## Indications

FESS may be recommended for:

- **Chronic Rhinosinusitis**: Lasting >12 weeks despite medical management
- **Recurrent Acute Sinusitis**: 4+ episodes per year
- **Nasal Polyps**: Benign growths obstructing sinuses
- **Sinus Mucoceles**: Blocked, expanding sinus cavities
- **Fungal Sinusitis**: Allergic or invasive fungal infections
- **CSF Leak Repair**: Cerebrospinal fluid leaks through skull base
- **Tumor Access**: Benign or malignant lesions requiring removal
- **Orbital or Intracranial Complications**: From sinus disease
- **Failed Medical Management**: After 3-6 months of appropriate therapy

## Medical Management (Must Try First)

Before surgery, patients typically undergo:
- Nasal saline irrigations
- Intranasal corticosteroid sprays
- Oral corticosteroids (short courses)
- Antibiotics (if infection present)
- Allergy management (if indicated)
- Leukotriene modifiers
- Immunotherapy for allergies

## Pre-Operative Preparation

- **CT Scan**: Required for surgical planning and navigation
- **Endoscopy**: Office examination of nasal cavities
- **Allergy Testing**: May be recommended
- **Medical Optimization**:
  - Oral prednisone for 5-7 days before surgery
  - Continue nasal irrigations and sprays
- **Medications to Stop**:
  - Aspirin: 2 weeks before
  - NSAIDs: 1 week before
  - Blood thinners: As directed by surgeon
  - Herbal supplements: 2 weeks before
- **Smoking**: Must stop at least 4 weeks before (quit permanently recommended)
- **Fasting**: No food or drink for 6-8 hours
- **Arrangements**: Someone to drive home and stay with you for 24 hours

## The Procedure

- **Anesthesia**: General anesthesia
- **Duration**: 1-3 hours depending on extent of disease
- **Approach**: Entirely through the nostrils (no external incisions)
- **Image Guidance**: Computer-assisted navigation often used for safety
- **Technique**:
  1. Endoscope inserted through nostril
  2. Diseased tissue, polyps, and bone removed
  3. Sinus openings enlarged to improve drainage
  4. Preservation of normal mucosa (lining)
  5. May include septoplasty or turbinate reduction
- **Extent**: Varies from single sinus to complete pansinusitis surgery
- **Packing/Splints**: May be placed (dissolving or removable)
- **Hospital Stay**: Usually outpatient; overnight if extensive

## Types of FESS Procedures

- **Uncinectomy**: Opening maxillary sinus
- **Anterior Ethmoidectomy**: Clearing front ethmoid cells
- **Posterior Ethmoidectomy**: Clearing back ethmoid cells
- **Maxillary Antrostomy**: Enlarging maxillary sinus opening
- **Sphenoidotomy**: Opening sphenoid sinus
- **Frontal Sinusotomy (Draf I, II, III)**: Opening frontal sinus (varying degrees)
- **Polypectomy**: Removal of nasal polyps
- **Balloon Sinuplasty**: Dilating sinus openings with balloon (less invasive option)

## Post-Operative Care

### First 24-48 Hours
- **Head Elevation**: Keep head elevated 30-45 degrees
- **Ice Packs**: Apply to face/nose to reduce swelling and bleeding
- **No Blowing Nose**: Absolutely critical for at least 7-10 days

- **Activity**: Rest, minimal exertion
- **Diet**: Light diet, avoid hot liquids initially

### First Week
- **Nasal Hygiene** (MOST IMPORTANT):
  - High-volume saline irrigations 4-6 times daily
  - Begin 24-48 hours after surgery
  - Critical for removing blood clots and debris
  - Promotes healing and prevents scarring
- **Medications**:
  - Pain medication as needed
  - Antibiotics if prescribed
  - Oral steroids if prescribed
  - NO nasal sprays until cleared by surgeon

## Expected Outcomes and Success Rates

### Symptom Improvement
- **Overall Success**: 80-90% experience significant improvement
- **Complete Resolution**: Rare; goal is improvement, not perfection
- **Quality of Life**: Significant improvement in most patients

### Specific Outcomes
- **Chronic Rhinosinusitis**: 70-90% improvement
- **Nasal Polyps**: Initial removal successful, but 40-80% recurrence over 10 years without medical therapy
- **Smell Improvement**: 60-70% if loss was due to inflammation
- **Headache/Facial Pain**: 60-80% improvement if truly sinus-related
- **Infection Frequency**: 50-70% reduction

### Factors Affecting Success
- **Asthma**: Lower success rate, higher recurrence
- **Aspirin Sensitivity**: Higher polyp recurrence
- **Smoking**: Significantly worse outcomes
- **Medical Compliance**: Post-op irrigations and sprays critical

6. **Biologic Therapy**: If severe polyps (Dupixent, Xolair, Nucala)

### Surgeon Factors
- Experience and skill
- Use of image guidance
- Preservation of healthy tissue
- Adequate opening of sinuses

## Special Considerations

### Asthma Patients
- Higher risk of polyp recurrence
- May require biologic therapy
- Better asthma control often achieved after FESS

### Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease (AERD)
- Triad: Asthma, nasal polyps, aspirin sensitivity
- Very high polyp recurrence rate (60-90%)
- Requires long-term medical management
- Aspirin desensitization may be beneficial

### Cystic Fibrosis
- Extensive polyp disease common
- More aggressive surgery often needed
- Higher revision rate
- Requires specialized CF center care

### Immunodeficiency
- Higher infection risk
- May require IVIG (intravenous immunoglobulin)
- More frequent recurrence

### Prior Surgery
- Scar tissue makes revision more challenging
- Higher risk of complications
- May have altered anatomy

## Questions to Ask Your Surgeon

1. Which sinuses will you operate on?
2. Will you use image-guided navigation?
3. How many FESS procedures do you perform annually?
4. What is your complication rate?
5. Will I need packing or splints?
6. When will I have my first post-op visit?
7. How many debridement visits should I expect?
8. What are the chances I'll need revision surgery?
9. What medical therapy will I need long-term?
10. Am I a candidate for biologic therapy?

## Alternatives to Surgery

- **Extended Medical Therapy**: Longer trial of medications
- **Biologic Therapy**: Dupixent, Xolair, Nucala for severe polyps
- **Balloon Sinuplasty**: Less invasive, but limited indications
- **Observation**: Monitor symptoms, intervene if worsening

## Long-Term Management

Surgery is not a cure; it's a tool to help medical therapy work better.

### Lifelong Regimen
- Daily saline irrigations
- Nasal steroid sprays
- Allergy management
- Annual ENT follow-up
- CT scan every few years if symptomatic

### Warning Signs of Recurrence
- Worsening nasal obstruction
- Return of facial pressure
- Loss of smell
- Thick nasal drainage
- Recurrent infections

**Important**: FESS is highly effective but requires lifelong commitment to medical management. Success depends as much on post-operative care as on the surgery itself. Discuss your specific situation and long-term management plan with your surgeon.

**Emergency Contact**: If you experience vision changes, severe headache, clear watery drainage, or severe bleeding after surgery, contact your surgeon immediately or go to the nearest emergency room.
