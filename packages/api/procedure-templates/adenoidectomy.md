# Adenoidectomy - Patient Information

## What is an Adenoidectomy?

An adenoidectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the adenoids — lymphoid tissue located in the back of the nasal cavity where the nose connects to the throat (nasopharynx). Unlike tonsils, adenoids cannot be seen by looking in the mouth and typically shrink naturally with age.

## Indications

An adenoidectomy may be recommended for:

- **Chronic Nasal Obstruction**: Mouth breathing, especially at night
- **Recurrent Ear Infections**: 4+ episodes per year despite medical treatment
- **Persistent Ear Fluid**: Chronic otitis media with effusion lasting >3 months
- **Sleep-Disordered Breathing**: Snoring, sleep apnea caused by adenoid hypertrophy
- **Chronic Sinusitis**: Recurrent sinus infections due to adenoid obstruction
- **Recurrent Adenoiditis**: Chronic infection of adenoid tissue
- **Craniofacial Development**: Preventing "adenoid facies" in children
- **Combined with Tonsillectomy**: Often performed together (T&A)

## Who Needs This Procedure?

- **Most Common Age**: 2-7 years old
- **Can Be Performed**: In older children and adults if adenoids remain enlarged
- **Assessment**: Size determined by flexible nasal endoscopy or X-ray

## Pre-Operative Preparation

- **Medical History**: List all medications, allergies, previous surgeries
- **Physical Exam**: Examination of nose, throat, and ears
- **Hearing Test**: May be performed if ear fluid present
- **Fasting**: No food or drink for 6-8 hours before surgery
- **Medications**: Stop aspirin, ibuprofen as directed
- **Arrangements**: Adult to drive home and supervise for 24 hours

## The Procedure

- **Anesthesia**: General anesthesia (child will be asleep)
- **Duration**: 20-30 minutes
- **Approach**: Through the mouth, no external incisions
- **Technique**:
  - Curette (scraping device)
  - Electrocautery
  - Suction cautery
  - Microdebrider
- **Bleeding Control**: Packing or cautery to stop bleeding
- **Ear Tubes**: Often placed simultaneously if ear fluid present
- **Hospital Stay**: Usually outpatient (same-day discharge)

## Post-Operative Care

### First 24 Hours
- **Pain**: Throat discomfort, nasal congestion
- **Position**: Slightly elevated head
- **Diet**: Cool, soft foods and plenty of fluids
- **Activity**: Rest, quiet play for children
- **Medications**: Pain reliever as prescribed

### First Week
- **Diet**:
  - Soft, cool foods (ice cream, yogurt, pudding, smoothies)
  - Avoid hard, crunchy, hot, or spicy foods
  - Encourage fluid intake (very important)
- **Nasal Care**:
  - Saline nasal spray/drops 3-4 times daily
  - Gentle nose blowing (after 2-3 days)
  - Expect blood-tinged mucus for 3-5 days
- **Activity**:
  - Light activity only
  - No swimming for 2 weeks
  - Return to school in 2-3 days typically
- **Oral Hygiene**: Gentle brushing, avoid harsh gargling

### Weeks 2-3
- **Diet**: Gradual return to normal diet
- **Activity**: Resume normal activities
- **Nasal Symptoms**: Congestion improves, drainage decreases
- **Follow-Up**: Visit typically scheduled 2-3 weeks post-op

## Expected Post-Operative Symptoms

### Normal and Expected
1. **Nasal Congestion**: May worsen initially before improving
2. **Halitosis (Bad Breath)**: From healing tissue, normal for 1-2 weeks
3. **Snoring**: May actually increase temporarily due to swelling
4. **Throat Pain**: Mild to moderate for 3-5 days
5. **Ear Pain**: Referred pain from throat, common
6. **Nasal Drainage**: Blood-tinged mucus for several days
7. **Voice Changes**: Temporary "nasal" quality may change to more normal
8. **Low-Grade Fever**: <101°F for first 2-3 days

- **Special Precautions**: Clotting factor replacement may be required

### Down Syndrome
- **Increased Risk**: Higher anesthetic and airway management risks
- **Atlantoaxial Instability**: Neck X-rays may be needed
- **Hospital Setting**: May require overnight observation

## Combination with Other Procedures

Often performed with:
- **Tonsillectomy (T&A)**: Most common combination
- **Myringotomy with Tube Placement**: For ear fluid
- **Endoscopic Sinus Surgery**: For chronic sinusitis (rare in children)

## Recovery Timeline

- **Day 1-3**: Most discomfort, nasal congestion, throat pain
- **Day 4-7**: Gradual improvement, return to normal diet
- **Week 2**: Most symptoms resolved, return to full activities
- **Week 3-4**: Follow-up visit, assess healing
- **Months 1-3**: Full benefits realized

## Questions to Ask Your Surgeon

1. Does my child really need this procedure, or can we try medical management longer?
2. Will you also recommend ear tubes?
3. What are the chances adenoids will regrow?
4. How long will my child need to stay home from school/daycare?
5. What pain medication will be prescribed?
6. Are there any specific risks for my child based on their medical history?
7. When should we see improvement in symptoms?

## Alternatives to Surgery

- **Observation**: "Watchful waiting" if symptoms mild
- **Medical Management**:
  - Nasal steroid sprays
  - Antihistamines for allergies
  - Antibiotics for infections
- **Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)**: For sleep apnea (difficult in young children)
- **Time**: Adenoids naturally shrink with age

## Long-Term Outcomes

- **Speech**: Usually no long-term effect; voice may become less "nasal"
- **Immune Function**: No significant impact on overall immunity
- **Growth and Development**: Improved if sleep apnea was present
- **Facial Development**: May prevent "adenoid facies" (long face, open mouth posture)

## Parent/Caregiver Tips

### Before Surgery
- Explain procedure to child in age-appropriate terms
- Read children's books about surgery
- Arrange for time off work/care for siblings
- Prepare home with soft foods, ice pops, entertainment

### After Surgery
- Keep child calm and quiet first 24 hours
- Offer fluids frequently, even small sips
- Cool mist humidifier in bedroom
- Monitor for bleeding or concerning symptoms
- Be patient with temporary behavior changes (irritability, clingy behavior)
- Keep follow-up appointments
