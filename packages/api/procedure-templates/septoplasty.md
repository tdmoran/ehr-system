# Septoplasty - Patient Information

## What is a Septoplasty?

A septoplasty is a surgical procedure to straighten the nasal septum — the wall of bone and cartilage that divides the nasal cavity into two nostrils. When the septum is crooked or deviated, it can cause breathing difficulties, chronic sinus problems, and other health issues.

## Indications

A septoplasty may be recommended for:

- **Nasal Obstruction**: Difficulty breathing through one or both nostrils
- **Chronic Sinusitis**: Recurrent sinus infections due to impaired drainage
- **Recurrent Nosebleeds**: Caused by airflow turbulence from septal deviation
- **Sleep-Disordered Breathing**: Contributing to snoring or sleep apnea
- **Facial Pain or Headaches**: Related to sinus pressure from blocked drainage
- **Failed Medical Management**: Symptoms not improved with nasal sprays or medications
- **Access for Other Procedures**: To reach areas for endoscopic sinus surgery or tumor removal

## Anatomy

- **Nasal Septum**: Composed of cartilage anteriorly and bone (vomer, perpendicular plate of ethmoid) posteriorly
- **Deviation Types**: C-shaped, S-shaped, spur, or combination
- **Associated Structures**: Turbinates (often reduced during septoplasty)

## Pre-Operative Preparation

- **Medical History**: Inform surgeon of all medications, allergies, bleeding disorders
- **Imaging**: CT scan may be obtained to evaluate sinuses and septum
- **Photography**: External and internal nasal photos for medical record
- **Blood Tests**: May be required to check clotting function
- **Medications to Stop**:
  - Aspirin: 2 weeks before surgery
  - NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen): 1 week before
  - Blood thinners: As directed by surgeon
  - Herbal supplements: 2 weeks before (especially ginkgo, garlic, ginseng)
- **Fasting**: No food or drink for 6-8 hours before surgery
- **Smoking**: Must stop at least 4 weeks before (ideally quit permanently)
- **Arrangements**: Someone to drive you home and stay with you for 24 hours

## The Procedure

- **Anesthesia**: General anesthesia (asleep) or local anesthesia with sedation
- **Duration**: Typically 60-90 minutes
- **Approach**: Usually performed entirely through the nostrils (no external incisions)
- **Technique**:
  1. Incision inside nose along septum
  2. Mucosa lifted from cartilage and bone
  3. Deviated portions repositioned or removed
  4. Septum reconstructed in midline position
  5. Mucosa replaced and incision closed
- **Additional Procedures**: Often combined with:
  - Turbinate reduction (to improve airflow)
  - Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS)
  - Rhinoplasty (cosmetic nose surgery)
- **Nasal Packing**: May or may not be used (surgeon-dependent)
- **Splints**: Internal silicone splints often placed to support septum

## Post-Operative Care

### Immediate (First 24 Hours)
- **Position**: Keep head elevated 30-45 degrees
- **Ice Packs**: Apply to face/nose to reduce swelling
- **Drip Pad**: Change as needed under nose to absorb drainage
- **No Blowing**: Do not blow your nose
- **Activity**: Rest, minimal activity
- **Diet**: Light diet, avoid hot liquids initially

### First Week
- **Nasal Hygiene**:
  - Saline spray/irrigation 4-6 times daily
  - Dab nostrils gently, do not blow
  - Keep nasal passages moist
- **Medications**:
  - Pain medication as prescribed
  - Antibiotics if prescribed
  - Decongestants (oral only, no nasal sprays)
- **Activity**: Light activity only, no bending or straining
- **Splint Removal**: Typically day 5-7 (may feel immediate relief)
- **Work/School**: Usually return in 3-5 days

### First Month
- **No Blowing**: Avoid for 7-10 days

   - **Severe**: Rare, may require return to OR (1-3%)
   - **Peak Risk**: First 24 hours and when packing/splints removed

2. **Infection**
   - Rare with antibiotics
   - Signs: Fever, increasing pain, purulent drainage
   - Treatment: Antibiotics, possible drainage

3. **Nasal Obstruction**
   - **Temporary**: Due to swelling, crusting (normal)
   - **Persistent**: May indicate inadequate correction
   - **Paradoxical**: Obstruction worse than before (rare)

4. **Pain and Discomfort**
   - Moderate pain, worse if packing used
   - Facial pressure and headache
   - Usually well-controlled with medication

5. **Adhesions (Synechiae)**

## Incomplete Correction or Recurrence

- **Residual Deviation**: 5-15% may have some persistent deviation
- **Recurrence**: Rare, but cartilage can shift over time
- **Revision Surgery**: May be needed in 5-10% of patients
- **Waiting Period**: Should wait 6-12 months before considering revision

## Warning Signs - Seek Immediate Medical Attention

Contact your surgeon or go to the emergency room if you experience:

- **Heavy Bleeding**: Continuous bleeding not controlled by pressure or ice
- **Clear Watery Drainage**: Especially with headache (possible CSF leak)
- **Vision Changes**: Blurred vision, double vision, loss of vision
- **Severe Eye Swelling**: Inability to open eye, eye bulging
- **High Fever**: Temperature >101.5°F (38.6°C)
- **Severe Uncontrolled Pain**: Not relieved by prescribed medication
- **Difficulty Breathing**: Severe obstruction, shortness of breath
- **Confusion or Altered Mental Status**: Possible infection spread
- **Severe Headache**: With stiff neck (possible meningitis)

## Expected Outcomes and Success Rates

### Breathing Improvement
- **Success Rate**: 70-90% experience significant improvement
- **Complete Resolution**: Not always possible, especially with other factors (allergies, turbinate hypertrophy)
- **Time to Full Benefit**: 3-6 months for complete healing and maximal improvement

### Factors Affecting Outcome
- **Severity of Deviation**: More severe deviations may have less complete correction
- **Turbinate Hypertrophy**: May need concurrent treatment
- **Allergies**: May persist and require ongoing management
- **Previous Surgery**: Scar tissue makes revision more challenging
- **Unrealistic Expectations**: Procedure improves structure, doesn't cure all nasal symptoms

### Patient Satisfaction
- **Overall Satisfaction**: 75-85% are satisfied with results
- **Would Repeat**: Majority would undergo surgery again
- **Quality of Life**: Significant improvement in nasal breathing-related quality of life

## Special Considerations

### Children and Adolescents
- **Age Considerations**: Generally avoid until facial growth complete (age 16-17)
- **Exceptions**: Severe obstruction affecting quality of life
- **Conservative Approach**: Limit cartilage removal to preserve growth

### Pregnancy
- **Timing**: Avoid during pregnancy due to anesthesia risks
- **Hormonal Changes**: Pregnancy causes nasal congestion (physiologic)
- **Postpone**: Until after delivery and breastfeeding complete

### Bleeding Disorders
- **Higher Risk**: Increased bleeding complications
- **Coordination**: Close coordination with hematologist
- **Special Precautions**: May require clotting factor replacement

### Previous Nasal Surgery/Trauma
- **Scar Tissue**: Makes surgery more challenging
- **Lower Success Rate**: May have less predictable outcomes
- **Longer Procedure**: May require grafting or reconstruction

## Alternatives to Surgery

- **Medical Management**: Nasal steroid sprays, oral decongestants, antihistamines
- **Nasal Dilators**: External or internal devices to open nasal passages
- **Allergy Treatment**: Immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis
- **Observation**: Monitor symptoms, intervene if worsening
